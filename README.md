# GenAI AppStore for ZimaOS (& CasaOS)

Your go-to App Store for Generative AI apps for CasaOS and ZimaOS devices like the [ZimaCube Pro](https://www.zimaspace.com/products/cube-personal-cloud?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=banner) sporting a RTX A2000 GPU.

## For who is this Third party App Store?

Creative professionals, marketing teams, developers and designers wanting to use Generative AI apps on their ZimaCube Pro or GPU-enabled CasaOS systems who want to jumpstart projects and save time getting up and running with Generative AI apps in live collab fashion. These one-click apps are meant to be easy to install and manage after setup, in actuality running these applications is quite hard to setup properly.

I value your time and want to enable you to get started in an eye-blink with Generative AI apps. One of my personal core missions is to make fundamental design processes more accessible to the general public.

Streamlining your content generation workflow, pipelines is just one of my specialties.

## Third party App store featuring Generative AI apps currently in active use and development on my ZimaCube Pro running ZimaOS.

Since I'm targeting my ZimaCube Pro product for my own business needs as a one stop shop digital content house, these apps are not primarily built for CasaOS but everything is compatible with CasaOS.

Like at the start of the [zimaos-coolify research](https://github.com/justserdar/zimaos-coolify), I document all of it so you can reproduce everything I so far yourself.

Note: You can read the original forked [CasaOS AppStore](#casaos-appstore) readme below.

## Documentation

I dedicated a subdomain with a blog and docs area for this App Store called the [Foundry Workbench](https://workbench.justserdar.dev/).

## Planned Apps

- *Pinikio*
- *Houdini* (Requires a Yearly SideVFX license to use)
- *ElizaOS*
- *StabilityMatrix*

## Future support

A update manager is coming soon to the App Store, I will be using Nuxt.js to build the frontend and TailwindCSS for styling.

- Like my nuxt-coolify module, I will be wrapping the ZimaOS API into a Nuxt module too allow communication in realtime with the hardware from within the frontend. This allows us to streamline updating and handling apps on ZimaOS (rebuild nature of RAUC). CasaOS doesn't need this because it's a rolling release system.

This `ZimaOS update manager` will help you ease the migration of my containers from one version of ZimaOS to another.

Stay tuned for more updates!
