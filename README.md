# Learning repository and Third-party App Store dev environment for my ZimaCube Pro running ZimaOS.

Since I'm targeting my ZimaCube product for my own business needs as a one stop shop digital content house, 
I won't be directly building for CasaOS and what I do for ZimaOS is meant for on the ZimaCube.
To my knowledge because of the nature of CasaOS and ZimaOS they are cross-compatible in area's.

Like at the start of the [zimaos-coolify research](https://github.com/justserdar/zimaos-coolify), I document all of it so you can reproduce it yourself.

Note: You can read the original forked readme below.
